    """
     A struct containing a 3D shape model's edge topology.
     
     This struct contains all edges of a 3D mesh, and for each edge, it
     contains the two faces and the two vertices that are adjacent to that
     edge. This is used in the iterated closest edge fitting (ICEF).
     
     Note: The indices are 1-based, so 1 needs to be subtracted before using
     them as mesh indices. An index of 0 as first array element means that
     it's an edge that lies on the mesh boundary, i.e. they are only
     adjacent to one face.
     
     We should explore a less error-prone way to store this data, but that's
     how it is done in Matlab by the original code.
     
     adjacent_faces.size() is equal to adjacent_vertices.size().
